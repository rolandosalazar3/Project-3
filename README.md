# Project-3

The project consists of pulling data from two data sets located on kaggle for the top ranked universities in the United States based on the U.S News & World Report college ranking system. 
First, the two data sets were combined into a single CSV files and uploaded onto an SQL database.
A Flask API of the data was then created where the data would be pulled from to create our website.
JavaScript files were created containing maps made with Plotly and charts made with chart.js.
All files were then combined into one HTML/CSS.
